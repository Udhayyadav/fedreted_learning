# Federated Learning for Disease Prediction

This project implements a simple **Federated Learning** setup using TensorFlow, NumPy, and Pandas.
It trains local models on different partitions of data and aggregates them using **Federated Averaging**.

## Folders

- **data/**: Contains the training and testing CSV files.
- **models/**: Stores the saved global model after federated training.
- **results/**: Contains evaluation results like accuracies.
- **src/**: Contains all Python source code split into modular files.

---

## Files

- **data_preprocessing.py**: Functions for loading and preparing data.
- **model_utils.py**: Functions for creating and evaluating models.
- **federated_training.py**: Functions for client training and federated averaging.
- **main.py**: Main file to run the federated training pipeline.
- **requirements.txt**: List of Python libraries needed.

---

## How to Run

1. Install required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the main script:

```bash
python src/main.py
```

3. Outputs:
   - Global model saved at `models/global_model.h5`
   - Client accuracies and global accuracy saved at `results/accuracy.json`

## Requirements

- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Pandas
- scikit-learn

---

## Notes

- This project is designed for understanding basic federated learning concepts.
- You can adjust `num_clients` in `main.py` to simulate different numbers of clients.
- You can replace the dataset with any other classification dataset for experiments.
